Building:
autoreconf -I m4
./configure # (add --prefix=/path/to/prefix if you don't want it in the default location)
make

The penggy binary will be in prefix/sbin. Modify prefix/etc/penggy/penggy.conf and prefix/etc/penggy/aol-secrets as explained below.

===================
Recommended config settings:

lock_path = /tmp
pid_file = /tmp/penggy.pid
access_method = tcpip

screen_name = SCREEN_NAME_HERE

place a line as follows in the aol-secrets file:

SCREEN_NAME_HERE        PASSWORD_HERE

It seems sometimes it's necessary to be connected with an AOL client when attempting to connect with pengfork.
